# Coffee-Formatter

A formatter for CoffeeScript

## Status

The project is under development and is not usable at this moment.  Please check back later.

## Things to note

This project is written in Literate CoffeeScript (extension '.litcoffee'), which isn't syntax-highlighted by Github at this moment.

To read the code, it's suggested to go to `docs/` folder.  For example, `docs/formatter.html` contains properly highlighted code for `formatter.litcoffee`.

To run the test suite, install [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) and run `mocha` in the base directory.
